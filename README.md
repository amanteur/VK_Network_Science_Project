# VK_Network_Science_Project
Descriptive analysis for my social ego-network
Network Summary (VK_project_1_make_graph.ipynb and VK_project_2_Summary.ipynb)
●	Network source and preprocessing\\
●	Node/Edge attributes\\
●	Size, Order
●	Diameter, radius
●	Clustering Coefficient (global, average local, histogram of locals)
●	Average path length (+histogram)
●	Degree distribution, fitting models and coefficient from regression/MLE/KS-test
●	Gorgeous network layout

Structural Analysis (VK_project_3_Structure.ipynb)
●	The closest random graph model similar to your social network (compare at least three models from lectures, such as ER, BA, WS). Check three real-world network properties on chosen random graph models and your ego-network, compare the results
●	Degree/Closeness/Betweenness centralities (optional: Katz, Bonacich) 
●	Top nodes interpretation (not just surnames, but how are they related to you)
●	Page-Rank. HITS. Correlation comparison of centralities and prestige. Comparison of top nodes
●	Assortative Mixing according to node attributes (usually sex, city, educational status)
●	Node structural equivalence/similarity (interpret how they are similar from communicative patterns)

Community Detection (VK_project_4_Community_Detection.ipynb)
●	Clique search, k-cores visualization and interpretation
●	Best results of various community detection algorithms, both in terms of interpretation and some quality criterion (modularity, silhouette, ground truth partition)
●	The results should be visible on the network layout
●	Interpretations should be written over image with community detection (use Paint, for e.g.)
